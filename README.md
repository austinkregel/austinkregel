### 👋 Hello! I'm Austin.

My favorite type of projects to work on are interal automation tools. I don't handle client-facing preasure well, but I excel at building tools which save time. 

🌱 Currently learning how to write tests for JavaScript (React specifically) 😵 and how to work with my ADHD as opposed to fighting it.

🏗️ I spent the first 3 years of my career building a glorafied excel sheet for tracking RMA requests, now I work in the automotive industry helping automate dynamic ad creation.

🏠 Outside of work, I love to tinker with microelectronics, hyrdoponics, home-automation, and tracking my own data. I've used Arduino, Particle Photon, ESP32, and ESP01 devices as well as custom circuit design through [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/). I also built a [finance tracking tool](https://github.com/austinkregel/finance) that uses the [Plaid API](https://plaid.com/) to fetch transactions, and issue webhook notifications.

💬 Ask me about... anything? :D My inbox is open, but please start the subject with `github:` I have an email filter to help sort my mail and I wouldn't want it to go unnoticed 😄

### üëã Hello! I'm Austin.

<img align='right'  src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=austinkregel&show_icons=true&theme=dark" width="380">

My favorite type of projects to work on are interal automations and tooling. I also like tackling complex problems, I've got a lot of experience refactoring old code, and writing metric based reporting systems üììüëÄ

üå± Currently learning how to programmatically manipulate PHP to refactor code en masse to accelerate developmentüëÄ. As my work team has fluctuated from 5 developers, to 12 developers, to 3, back to 11 devs, and down to 2 devs over the last 5 years; I've grown increaslingly more concerned with maintainability and managing complexity with large code bases.

üèóÔ∏è I spent the first 3 years of my career building a glorafied excel sheet for tracking RMA requests, now I work in the automotive industry helping automate dynamic ad creation for an internal team.

üè† Outside of work, I love to tinker with microelectronics, hyrdoponics, home-automation, and tracking my own data. I've used Arduino, Particle Photon, ESP32, and ESP01 devices as well as custom circuit design through [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/). I also built a [finance tracking tool](https://github.com/austinkregel/finance) that uses the [Plaid API](https://plaid.com/) to fetch transactions, and issue webhook notifications.

üí¨ Ask me about... anything? :D My inbox is open please use `github@kregel.email` to contact me... No soliciting, I don't want to buy your services, but if you need help with one of my projects or want to chat, please send me an email.

### Loosely maintained side projects
 - [aut.hair](https://aut.hair) an OAuth server that uses Laravel Passport and Socialite to enable a light central authentication portal. [Open sourced on Github](https://github.com/austinkregel/aut.hair)
 - [Lazy.Build](https://lazy.build) is an open source [collection of scripts](https://github.com/Lazy-Build/scripts) meant to be run on a newly installed operating system for convienece.
 - [Helpful Information](https://github.com/helpful-information) intended to be a collection of websites to provide quick and easy access to various information.
   - [Crisis.tools](https://crisis.tools) a woefully incomplete list of information useful when someone is in crisis, [open source on Github](https://github.com/helpful-information/crisis.tools)
   - [Learning.cheap](https://learning.cheap) an incomplete list of video and online resources for learning general information
   - [Learn.support](https://learn.support) intended to be a project index
 - [Laravel Flight](https://github.com/austinkregel/laravel-flight) the easiest way to secure Laravel applications without needing to write any additional code. Run migrations, add a few `env` variables, and grab some Oauth2 credentials from your favorite provider, and you can secure your apps; even if it's just a horizon queue.
 - [Re:base](https://github.com/austinkregel/re-base) a passion projection heavily inspired by the now defunct [koding](https://www.koding.com/) üò¢ a lightweight but heavy handed code editor written in Vue and NodeJS
 - [Michigan Cannabis Club](https://michigancannabis.club) an consumer information hub for cannabis related alerts in Michigan. [Open sourced](https://github.com/austinkregel/cannabis-consumer-information), it scans the Michigan website for newly released recalls and sends alerts to anyone who reported having purchased an infected product; assuming the MRA lists all of the infected products.
 - [ChangeLager](https://github.com/austinkregel/changelager) a project to automate the building of release logs for projects that use logical git commits.
 - [Laravel Nova Failed Jobs Tool](https://github.com/austinkregel/nova-failed-jobs-tool) and the non-Laravel specific package it's based on [php-exception-probe](https://github.com/austinkregel/php-exception-probe). The nova package provides an interface to rerun failed jobs, and to inspect the exception from Nova with code context. `php-exception-probe` is how the interface gets the code context from the exceptions produced by the failed jobs.
 - [Spork](https://github.com/austinkregel/spork) a personal everything project that allows me to test ideas and expiriment with configurations, servers, coordinating external services, code generation and dynamic editing, and so much more. üößüî® This app is under frequent and heavy construction...
